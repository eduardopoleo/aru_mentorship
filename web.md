- The Web
  - Bunch of computers that can communicate by sending information (packets) to each other through a couple of different protocols (UDP and TCP)
    UDP -> fire and forget it's used mostly when performance is of the essence and missing, e.g real time video games
    TCP -> ensure packages are delivered and in order. Less performant but necessary when you need reliability, e.g web http requests
  - These lower level protocols really do not care about what kind of data you send through they just understand the concept of packets. Higher level protocols are built on top of them like http and https
  - Even with http you can send different type of data such as:
    - Documents: html, xml etc
    - Static files: JS, CSS, images, media etc
  - When using http the normally there are 2 types of actors:
    - server -> the computer running a web server which is actively waiting for a response
    - client -> the computer requesting the information to the server
    - A computer can be both server and client and there are literally billions of devices connected and communicating with each other on a daily basis
  - Among these there is one kind of devices that are very special, the personal computer that communicate with the internet through a browser.
- The Browser
  - The browser is a "multi compiler" that can connect to the internet request all these different type of information (html, css, js, etc) and is able to translate them correspondingly e.g:
    - html.divs      -> rectangles
    - css.background -> color
    - js             -> interactivity
- Web Evolution
  - Initially most of the web was static, meaning that content on the pages could only be changed through deployments. The Web Master needed to upload a new version of the site if something needed to change
  - Not long after ppl started figuring out that they could hook their site to databases and start generated dynamic data. I think this was a logical step since databases already existed it was just a matter of writing the bit of glue code needed to get thing working (do not quote me on this)
  - The web proliferated and user adoption grew but there was another problem for every single interaction that the user wanted to make a full round trip for everything. 
    - An example: if an user filled out an long form and sent it to the server, the server could respond with a validation error and an empty form making the user to loose all the work. In this case it would have been easier to just be able to have a bit of logic to validate the form in the browser.
  - AJAX! The interaction did not stop there and in 2004 ajax was born which added a way to make full on request to the server directly from javascript and modify the contents of the page without having to do a full page request. This opened a new new world of posibilities for instance
    - having a full page refresh for say a like in a post makes for a very jarring experience. In tis particular example you could also save work in the server because the only thing that you needed to take care of was to account for the like. As opposed to having to recalculate the entire page again.
  - At this point the web was becoming the de facto medium to share information and browsers the main gateway and having control of this gateway meant big business $$$. Naturally, there were many competitors trying to take over the browser market. Each of this companies (netscape, MS, etc) had their own browser implementation which came with their own particularities, one specifically annoying was the difference between their JS runtime. Enter JQuery.
  - JQuery revolutionalized the web. Not only gave use a much easier query interface to interact with DOM elements (insert example) but it also dealt with most of the browser implementation details developers did not want to worry about. To this day JQuery is the most popular JS library use to add interactivity to sites despite react, svelte etc...
